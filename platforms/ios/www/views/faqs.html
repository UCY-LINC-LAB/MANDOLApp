        What is Hate Speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          In the Oxford dictionary hate is defined as an emotion of "intense dislike", for someone or something. Hate is verbalised in speech and used to express "hatred  or  intolerance  of  other  social  groups,  especially  on  the  basis  of  race  or sexuality".
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the framework of this wide definition, more restricted ones may be issued for different  purposes,  starting  from  the  promotion  of peace  among  humankind  to  the prohibition  of unlawful  acts,  through  the  definition  of  what  should  be  illegal  but  is currently not, on which all people do not necessarily agree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has stated, that they consider that “hate speech shall be understood as covering all  forms  of  expression  which  spread,  incite,  promote  or  justify  racial  hatred, xenophobia,  anti-Semitism  or other  forms  of  hatred based  on  intolerance,  including: intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility against minorities, migrants and people of immigrant origin”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since  there  is  no  universal  definition,  some  web  pages  and  social  platforms  have adopted their own definitions of hate speech. Facebook defines the term ‘hate speech’ as “direct  and  serious  attacks  on  any  protected  category  of  people  based  on  their  race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or disease.

        What is legally considered Hate Speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          Legally speaking, hate speech is the speech that is prohibited by the law which applies to the situation. This very clear and simple  definition hides a very complex situation in practice, even within the E.U.
        </p>
        <p>
          The E.U. Member States' legislations show huge  disparities,  which  may  lead  to  the  punishment,  non-punishment  or  lower punishment  of  certain  behaviours  or  of  certain  grounds motivating  the  behaviour, depending on the precise circumstances that surround the potential offence, even in one single country, and depending on the country that will be competent to judge the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking  this  situation  into  account,  the  comparative study  which  is  available  in  the MANDOLA  intermediate  deliverable  D2.1,  proposes  a  classification  of  hatred  content into three categories: (1) illegal in all or almost all the studied EU Member States, (2) illegal or partly illegal in a majority of these countries; (3) illegal in a minority of these countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following behaviours are illegal in all or almost all the studied EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Publicly inciting hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group determined on the basis/grounds of their race, national or ethnic origin, and religion, if the incitement is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order, or public peace, or which  is  threatening,  abusive  or  insulting.
            </li>
            <li>Making available to the public xenophobic or racist material which incites hatred through a computer system, for the same illegal grounds as mentioned above</li>
            <li>Publicly insulting a person or a group of persons by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or religion.</li>
            <li>Public defamation, which is, in many countries, prohibited whatever the grounds. However,  in  certain  countries  an  illegal  motivation is necessary.</li>
            <li>Direct  or  indirect  discrimination,  in  particular  areas including harassment.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The  following  behaviours  are  illegal  or  partly  illegal  in  a  majority  of  the  studied  EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>Establishing or participating in organisations that promote or incite discrimination or violence or hatred.</li>
            <li>Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes against peace, crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</li>
            <li>Sending  of  grossly  offensive  and/or  indecent  or  obscene  or  menacing  character messages or whatever other conteny.</li>
            <li>Direct public incitement to commit any offence or crime, for any ground.</li>
            <li>Threatening  of  a  natural  person,  motivated  by  racism  or  xenophobia,  through  a computer  system.</li>
            <li>In  addition,  an  illegal  motivation  is  an  aggravating  circumstance  of  all  the  penal infringements  in  5  countries  out  of  10,  and  of  certain  penal  infringements  in  3 countries out of 1.</li>
            <li>Insult to religion.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following behaviours are illegal in a minority of the studied EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>Sending of a message, or whatever content, which can cause annoyance, harassment and / or needless anxiety to another person, which the sender knows to be false, for any ground. </li>
            <li>Promotion or public incitement to hostility or violence between communities.</li>
            <li>Recording of images of the commission of a crime or offence against a person.</li>
            <li>
              Realising a montage with the talk or the images of a third party without his or her consent, if it is not obvious that it is a montage or if it is not specified that it is a montage, for any ground.
            </li>
            <li>To misuse / usurp someone else's identity, for any ground. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding  specifically  illegal  grounds,  the  comparative  study  shows  that  all  the following  ones  may  be  taken  into  consideration,  depending  on    the  country  and depending on the exact behaviour to sanction and it s circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  most  infringements,  including  incitement  to  racial  hatred:  race; national and ethnic origins; religion; sexual preferences or orientation or hetero or homosexuality;disability or bodily, psychological or mental handicap; sex or sex and gender motives or gender; sexual identity or gender identity; national or ethnical ancestry or genealogical origin or descent or ethnic, racial or national belonging of family  members;  origins  or  social  origins;  nationality;  skin  colour;  ideology  or beliefs or political orphilosophical beliefs; familiar situation; age; civil status; birth; fortune;  language;  state  of  health;  illness;  physical  or  genetic  characteristics; membership of the travelling community.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  the  making  available  of  material  inciting  or  promoting  hatred, violence or discrimination, additional (to the paragraph above) illegal motivations are in one country flags, emblems, pins, uniforms, slogans, salutation formulas or any other signs which promote fascist, racist or xenophobic ideas, conceptions or doctrines.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  the  participation  in  organisations  that  promote  or  incite discrimination or violence or hatred, additional grounds might be those mentioned in  relation  with incitement  to  hatred  above,  and,  in  one  country,  social  category, non-transmissible  chronic  disease,  HIV  infection,  belonging  to  a  disadvantaged category,  as  well  as  any criterion  which  would  restrict  or  discharge  the acknowledgement,  use  or  exercise  -  in  equal  conditions  -  of  human  rights  and fundamental  liberties  or  rights  acknowledged  by law,  in  the  political,  economic, social and cultural fields or in any other field of the public life.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  aggravating  circumstances,  additional  grounds  might  be  those mentioned in relation with incitement to hatred above, and racist, xenophobic or other  inhuman (Germany);  wealth,  chronic  non-contagious  disease  or  HIV/AIDS infection, social category, inclusion in a unflavoured category, or any other criterion (Romania, in relation to harassment). We can notice that some of these grounds are widely open to interpretation.

        Who are the victims of hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          Anyone may be a victim of hate speech. However, there are persons or groups or people much more likely to be the subjects of hate  speech,  partly  due  to  the  current  socio-political  context or  the  current  existing conflicts between beliefs or personal morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legally speaking, victims of hate speech are the persons who are targeted by the speech, or  eventually,  where  the  law  provides  for  it,  the  people  who  belong  to  a  group,  a community or a religion which is the target of the hate speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the framework of some specific infringements, a complaint of the victim is necessary in order to prosecute the author of the illegal behaviour.
