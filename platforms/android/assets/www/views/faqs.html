        What is Hate Speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          In the Oxford dictionary hate is defined as an emotion of "intense dislike", for someone or something. Hate is verbalised in speech and used to express "hatred  or  intolerance  of  other  social  groups,  especially  on  the  basis  of  race  or sexuality".
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the framework of this wide definition, more restricted ones may be issued for different  purposes,  starting  from  the  promotion  of peace  among  humankind  to  the prohibition  of unlawful  acts,  through  the  definition  of  what  should  be  illegal  but  is currently not, on which all people do not necessarily agree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has stated, that they consider that “hate speech shall be understood as covering all  forms  of  expression  which  spread,  incite,  promote  or  justify  racial  hatred, xenophobia,  anti-Semitism  or other  forms  of  hatred based  on  intolerance,  including: intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility against minorities, migrants and people of immigrant origin”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since  there  is  no  universal  definition,  some  web  pages  and  social  platforms  have adopted their own definitions of hate speech. Facebook defines the term ‘hate speech’ as “direct  and  serious  attacks  on  any  protected  category  of  people  based  on  their  race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or disease.

        What is legally considered Hate Speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          Legally speaking, hate speech is the speech that is prohibited by the law which applies to the situation. This very clear and simple  definition hides a very complex situation in practice, even within the E.U.
        </p>
        <p>
          The E.U. Member States' legislations show huge  disparities,  which  may  lead  to  the  punishment,  non-punishment  or  lower punishment  of  certain  behaviours  or  of  certain  grounds motivating  the  behaviour, depending on the precise circumstances that surround the potential offence, even in one single country, and depending on the country that will be competent to judge the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking  this  situation  into  account,  the  comparative study  which  is  available  in  the MANDOLA  intermediate  deliverable  D2.1,  proposes  a  classification  of  hatred  content into three categories: (1) illegal in all or almost all the studied EU Member States, (2) illegal or partly illegal in a majority of these countries; (3) illegal in a minority of these countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following behaviours are illegal in all or almost all the studied EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Publicly inciting hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group determined on the basis/grounds of their race, national or ethnic origin, and religion, if the incitement is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order, or public peace, or which  is  threatening,  abusive  or  insulting.
            </li>
            <li>Making available to the public xenophobic or racist material which incites hatred through a computer system, for the same illegal grounds as mentioned above</li>
            <li>Publicly insulting a person or a group of persons by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or religion.</li>
            <li>Public defamation, which is, in many countries, prohibited whatever the grounds. However,  in  certain  countries  an  illegal  motivation is necessary.</li>
            <li>Direct  or  indirect  discrimination,  in  particular  areas including harassment.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The  following  behaviours  are  illegal  or  partly  illegal  in  a  majority  of  the  studied  EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>Establishing or participating in organisations that promote or incite discrimination or violence or hatred.</li>
            <li>Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes against peace, crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</li>
            <li>Sending  of  grossly  offensive  and/or  indecent  or  obscene  or  menacing  character messages or whatever other conteny.</li>
            <li>Direct public incitement to commit any offence or crime, for any ground.</li>
            <li>Threatening  of  a  natural  person,  motivated  by  racism  or  xenophobia,  through  a computer  system.</li>
            <li>In  addition,  an  illegal  motivation  is  an  aggravating  circumstance  of  all  the  penal infringements  in  5  countries  out  of  10,  and  of  certain  penal  infringements  in  3 countries out of 1.</li>
            <li>Insult to religion.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following behaviours are illegal in a minority of the studied EU Member States:
          <ul>
            <li>Sending of a message, or whatever content, which can cause annoyance, harassment and / or needless anxiety to another person, which the sender knows to be false, for any ground. </li>
            <li>Promotion or public incitement to hostility or violence between communities.</li>
            <li>Recording of images of the commission of a crime or offence against a person.</li>
            <li>
              Realising a montage with the talk or the images of a third party without his or her consent, if it is not obvious that it is a montage or if it is not specified that it is a montage, for any ground.
            </li>
            <li>To misuse / usurp someone else's identity, for any ground. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding  specifically  illegal  grounds,  the  comparative  study  shows  that  all  the following  ones  may  be  taken  into  consideration,  depending  on    the  country  and depending on the exact behaviour to sanction and it s circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  most  infringements,  including  incitement  to  racial  hatred:  race; national and ethnic origins; religion; sexual preferences or orientation or hetero or homosexuality;disability or bodily, psychological or mental handicap; sex or sex and gender motives or gender; sexual identity or gender identity; national or ethnical ancestry or genealogical origin or descent or ethnic, racial or national belonging of family  members;  origins  or  social  origins;  nationality;  skin  colour;  ideology  or beliefs or political orphilosophical beliefs; familiar situation; age; civil status; birth; fortune;  language;  state  of  health;  illness;  physical  or  genetic  characteristics; membership of the travelling community.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  the  making  available  of  material  inciting  or  promoting  hatred, violence or discrimination, additional (to the paragraph above) illegal motivations are in one country flags, emblems, pins, uniforms, slogans, salutation formulas or any other signs which promote fascist, racist or xenophobic ideas, conceptions or doctrines.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  the  participation  in  organisations  that  promote  or  incite discrimination or violence or hatred, additional grounds might be those mentioned in  relation  with incitement  to  hatred  above,  and,  in  one  country,  social  category, non-transmissible  chronic  disease,  HIV  infection,  belonging  to  a  disadvantaged category,  as  well  as  any criterion  which  would  restrict  or  discharge  the acknowledgement,  use  or  exercise  -  in  equal  conditions  -  of  human  rights  and fundamental  liberties  or  rights  acknowledged  by law,  in  the  political,  economic, social and cultural fields or in any other field of the public life.
            </li>
            <li>
              In  relation  with  aggravating  circumstances,  additional  grounds  might  be  those mentioned in relation with incitement to hatred above, and racist, xenophobic or other  inhuman (Germany);  wealth,  chronic  non-contagious  disease  or  HIV/AIDS infection, social category, inclusion in a unflavoured category, or any other criterion (Romania, in relation to harassment). We can notice that some of these grounds are widely open to interpretation.

        Who are the victims of hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>
          Anyone may be a victim of hate speech. However, there are persons or groups or people much more likely to be the subjects of hate  speech,  partly  due  to  the  current  socio-political  context or  the  current  existing conflicts between beliefs or personal morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legally speaking, victims of hate speech are the persons who are targeted by the speech, or  eventually,  where  the  law  provides  for  it,  the  people  who  belong  to  a  group,  a community or a religion which is the target of the hate speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the framework of some specific infringements, a complaint of the victim is necessary in order to prosecute the author of the illegal behaviour.

         I believe I have encountered hate speech. What can I do about it?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>The answer of this question depends on the nature of the speech. Illegal speech must be combatted, whereas not illegal speech must be preserved in public places, since it is an essential  foundation  of  a  democratic  society,  and "one  of  the  basic  conditions  for  its progress  and  for  the  development  of  every  man". Some categories of speech are also only prohibited where they are public, and remain legal when made in private spheres or places (such as the incitement to hatred, which is in most countries only prohibited where publicly made). </p>

        What does Freedom of Expression allow us to say?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Covered  by  Article  10  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  Freedom  of expression is the right that every citizen and person has to express and communicate their  ideas  and  opinions  freely  and  fearlessly,  without  prohibitions  or  consequences, such  as  government  retaliation  or  censorship.  It  constitutes  one  of  the  essential foundations of a democratic society. On the basis of this Human right, we can not only express  ideas  that  are  well received,  but  also  to  those  that  offend,  shock  or  disturb (Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, § 49). </p>

        Why words can be harmful and sometimes dangerous?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Some words can be harmful. Some words can be considered as harmful, due to their importance and their capacity of hurting people when harmful words and speeches are directed to them. This phenomenon is often related to the disruption in self-image that individuals have to confront when hearing these kinds of words or speeches. Further, some words are particularly harmful when intentionally used to manifest intolerance, humiliation, or insult, or when they might incite violence or prejudicial action against an individual or group of people. </p>
        <p>Words  can  stimulate  actions,  reactions,  moods  and  beliefs.  They  can  also  stimulate atmospheres  of  fear  surrounding  the  victims  and  perhaps  even  causing  real  physical results. Hate speech victims could feel threatened and feel that their physical integrity is at risk, afraid that any response might irritate the hate speech instigator even more. In addition, the victims could cease their daily activities and isolate themselves.</p>
        <p>As in many crimes, hate crimes infringe on personal qualities that make up the core of one’s  personality  and  identity.  Sometimes  hate  attacks  are  exceptionally  offensive, violent, public, and visible, and that is another reason why they have a negative impact both  on  the  social  order  and  security,  and  on  the  opinion  people  might  have  about certain groups of people or their members. </p>

        Is hate speech forbidden online?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Hate speech (illegal by definition) which is prohibited off-line is also prohibited on-line. Moreover, certain countries, implementing the additional protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, created provisions that criminalise some hatred-related behaviour that are not  prohibited  off-line.  In  addition,  many  countries  provide  for  aggravating circumstances where certain kind of prohibited hate speech is published through the use of a computer system or electronic communications.</p>
        <p>However, it must be noted that, in most cases, only public hatred content is prohibited, even though certain countries also prohibit non-public content. Content sent to a limited group of identified persons will generally only be punishable where they constitute an insult,  defamation,  or  eventually  a  threat  (for  further  details  on  this  entry  see  the Mandola D2.1 intermediate). </p>

        <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
        Is Hate speech and hate crime the same thing?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Answering this question imposes to define notions beforehand. Hate speech is a hateful content, which might be motivated by usually evoked motivations such as race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, but also by any other ground. Depending on the country, the notion of "hate crime" may refer to all the penal infringements or offences that are committed for hateful reasons (against individuals, their community or their property), or to the more harshly punished category of penal infringements (in system that classify infringements in categories such as contraventions, misdemeanours and crimes).  </p>
        <p>Even by understanding "hate crime" as covering all penal infringements, the answer to the question is no. As already explained, hate is a common human feeling, and is not illegal in all situations, in order to give room to freedom of expression and to enable societal debates or individual discussions (for example, in some countries, an insult is not  punishable  if  it  has  been  committed  in  response  to  a  primary  attack  -  see  D2.1 intermediate) </p>

        I believe I have been a target of hate speech? What are my rights as a victim?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Any  victim  of  hate  speech  should  lodge  a  complaint in  order  to  get  the  perpetrator penally punished. In certain situations, most of the time, this is a pre-condition to the proceedings  against  the  perpetrator  (especially  in case  of  insult  and  defamation).  In addition, even if the content was judged non illegal under the "hate speech" category, the content may be illegal toward the victim for other reasons than hate, and a complaint is the only way to get the perpetrator punished. Beside penal proceedings, the victim may also  obtain  damages  under  civil  law  or  administrative  law, before  the  relevant  Court (civil damages can also often be obtained before the penal judge). </p>

        Which legal protection against Hate Speech does exist within EU?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Hate  speech  is  addressed  in  several  legal  instruments  at  the  International  and  the European Union level. The European Union ones are binding for the EU Member States, whereas International ones are only binding for the EU Member States which ratified them or acceded to them. In any case, with the exception of some Treaties that may in some countries have a direct effect, such as the European Convention on Human rights (which  is  an  international  instrument  despite its  name),  International  and  National instruments  are  not  directly  applicable  in  internal  law,  and  must  be  transposed  into domestic law by the State for this purpose.  </p>
        <p>As a result, the competent judge is the national one. However, national Courts may in certain cases refer to the Court of justice of the European Union to obtain a decision in relation with the violation of a EU legal instrument. In addition, citizens are entitled to go before the European Court of Human Rights (E. Court H. R. - which is an international Court at the Council of Europe level), once they have exhausted domestic remedies, if hey consider that their State did not respect a provision of the European Convention on Human  Rights.  The  E.  Court  H.  R.  considers  that  "tolerance  and  respect  for  the  equal dignity  of  all  human  beings  constitute  the  foundations  of  a  democratic,  pluralistic society". "As a consequence, in principle it might be considered necessary, in democratic societies, to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance (including religious intolerance), if it is ensured that the  (...)  'restrictions'  or  'sanctions'  that  are  imposed  are  proportionate  to  the  aim pursued".

        What are providers doing about online hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>The  continuous  growth  of  Internet  as  a  mean  of  communication,  along  with  the anonymity  that  it  provides,  has  enabled  the  prolife ration  of  hate-based  activities  in cyberspace, such as harassment and expressions of hate, which are now located beyond the realms of traditional Law Enforcement methods and Law prosecution. Therefore, it is needed for other cyber-entities, such as individual users or some web providers, to fight against this type of offence.  </p>
        <p>Web pages and forums are sometimes moderated, and where moderators are in place, they are responsible for confirming the proper functioning and adequate conformity to the rules of each web page and forum. There are web sites, social networks, and forums that have their own teams that review and evaluate reports on hate speech.  </p>
        <p>Facebook offers its own page notes on ‘Controversial, Harmful and Hateful Speech’, in which they assure that they “prohibit content deemed to be directly harmful, but allow content  that  is  offensive  or  controversial”.  Furthermore,  in  Facebook’s  Statement  of Rights and Responsibilities, hate speech is explicitly prohibited. They aim to maintain these regulations updated and adapted to legislation, so they: 1) Update their guidelines soliciting  feedback  from  legal experts,  representatives  of  the  women’s  coalition  and other groups that have historically faced discrimination; 2) Update the training for the teams  that  review  and  evaluate  reports  of  hateful  speech  or  harmful  content  on Facebook; 3) Increase the accountability of the creators of content that does not qualify as actionable hate speech but is cruel or insensitive by insisting that the authors stand behind the content they create, in order to monitor the activity of these users and be able to react fast if they start to publish prohibited content; 4) Establish more formal and direct lines of communication with representatives of groups working in this area, including women's groups, to assure expedited treatment of content they believe violate their standards.
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, on 31 May 2016, the European Commission together with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube  and  Microsoft  (“the  IT  companies”)  unveiled  a  code  of  conduct which includes a series of commitments to combat the spread of (illegal) hate speech online in Europe; in order to develop co- and self-regulatory approaches to fighting hate speech online. By signing this code of conduct, the IT companies commit to continuing their efforts  to  tackle  (illegal)  hate  speech  online.  Some  of  these  efforts  will  include  the continued development of internal procedures and staff training to guarantee that they review the majority of valid notifications for removal of (illegal) hate speech in less than 24 hours and remove or disable access to such content, if necessary. The IT companies will  also  endeavour  to  strengthen  their  ongoing  partnerships  with  civil  society organisations  who  will  help  flag  content  that  promotes  incitement  to  violence and hateful conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IT Companies also underline that the present code of conduct is aimed at guiding their  own  activities  as  well  as  sharing  best  practices  with  other  internet  companies, platforms  and  social  media  operators.  Nevertheless,  web  providers  are  welcome  to check and look for web page regulations in the Information Providers Guide included in the  European  Internet  Handbook,  which  provides  information  for  everyone  who develops and publishes material on EU websites, including webmasters, editors, content providers, web developers and contractors.

        Who is liable for hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Liability is an issue decided by courts of law or sometimes based on special decisions by agencies or tribunals empowered by law to arbitrate on these issues. There are a range of  liabilities  depending  on  the  content  of  the  hate  speech,  the  audience  for  the  hate speech, the impact of the hate speech and the reasonable prior knowledge of the impact of the hate speech on the audience and on the target of the hate speech. </p>
        <p>In addition, in a lot of countries, legal persons can also be liable, generally where the offence is committed by one of their representative and/or committed in their benefit. The liability of legal persons does not necessarily exclude the liability of natural persons. </p>
        <p>
          Exceptions to the rules afore-mentioned do exist:
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly,  some  countries  exclude  the  possibility,  in  certain  situations,  to  include liability  of  accomplices  (excluding  Ireland,  where offences  do  not  belong  to  the category  of  "indictable  offences"),  or  the  legal  persons  in  relation  with  certain infringements (case of Greece, Ireland, Spain, France, and Bulgaria) or just because such possible liability is not provided for at all by law (which is the case in Cyprus)</li>
            <li>Secondly, two countries (France and Spain), out of ten countries whose legislation has  been  studied,  have  created  a  special  liability regime  that  applies  to  press  or media. The content of these regimes vary, but the common result is to render liable specific persons who contributed for sure to the creation or to the publication of the content, or who are in charge of taking care of the lawfulness of published contents. Besides that, the liability of accomplices or of legal persons might be possible or not in  addition  (the  French  press  liability  regimes  enables  to  sue  the  author  as  an accomplice, in addition to the publication director, but legal persons (e.g. registered companies) cannot be declared liable; the Spanish media liability regime lists the different categories of authors that are exclusively liable, excludes the liability of any accomplice but enables the liability of legal persons).  </li>

        Which law applies to online hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Where the content is prohibited by penal law, investigations are usually the mission of law enforcement agencies, or sometimes of a judge, depending on the country. </p>

        What are the penalties for those found guilty of hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Due  to  the  Internet  being  an  egalitarian  way  of  communication,  a  unilateral  national content legislation does not always apply when prosecuting offences committed in such a globalised and decentralised landscape. Even though there have been efforts to agree on virtual borders in relation to cyberspace so as to regulate this type of offences, these efforts  were  unsuccessful  since  they  impacted  on  jurisdictional   and  sovereignty issues.  An  international  and multilateral  legislative  approach  to  investigate  and  fight against hate speech must and has progressively been adopted, even if it still  faces some challenges, most of them having to do with different commitments to free speech and regulation  in  different  countries.  The  Convention  of  Cybercrime  (Budapest, 23/11/2001) was the first international treaty on crimes committed via the Internet and other computer networks, and its aim was to set out a common criminal policy pursuing the protection of society against cybercrime, by fostering international co-operation and developing appropriate legislation. Its State Parties are represented by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY). There was an additional protocol to the Convention of Budapest,  concerning  the  criminalisation  of  acts  of  a  racist  and  xenophobic  nature committed through computer systems.
        </p>
        <p>On the basis of this agreement and on other agreements relating to penal law (such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination) or to cooperation in the penal area, bound States (see 5.10 above) are supposed to have in their legislation a common denominator of infringements, and basic rules enabling the territorial competence of their countries in certain cases (ensuring that way that at least one penal law applies in each case), and enabling cooperation in case of assistance request coming from a foreign LEA.

        Which persons are entitled to initiate legal proceedings against authors of hate speech?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>The answer to this question varies from country to country, and from offence to offence, in addition to the fact that laws generally set-up a maximum penalty, which the judge will adapt to the particular situation. It would be therefore too long and even impossible to answer precisely and exhaustively. </p>
        <p>However, knowing that most common penalties for natural persons are fine and / or imprisonment (in addition to several complementary penalties that might be applied in certain situations), the following ranges can be given as illustrations, on the basis of the comparative study of ten EU countries
          <ul>
            <li>Publicly  inciting  hatred,  or  making  available  to  the  public,  through  a  computer system, xenophobic or racist material which incites hatred: imprisonment up to 5 years and/or a fine up to €45 000. Particularities in Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000) and Spain (up to €144 000).  </li>
            <li>Establishing or participating in organisations that incite or promote discrimination or violence or hatred: imprisonment up to 10 years and/or a fine up to €20 500 - depending on the country. Particularities in Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000) and Spain (up to €288 000).  </li>
            <li>Hatred-related insults: imprisonment up to 1 years (5 years in two countries if other conditions are met) and/or a fine up to €22 500 (€34 000 in one country if other conditions  are  met)  -  depending  on  the  country.  Particularities  in  Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000), and Spain (up to €168 000). </li>
            <li>Public defamation for illegal reasons: imprisonment up to 5 years and/or a fine up to  €12  500  -  barring  aggravating  circumstances  -depending  on  the  country. Particularities in Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000), Spain (up to €288 000), and Romania (up to €26 640). </li>
            <li>Threatening  of  a  natural  person,  motivated  by  racism  or  xenophobia:  in  the  two countries  prohibiting  threats  without  other  conditions  but  illegal  grounds: imprisonment up to 3 and 5 years; in one country: fine up to €34 000. In relation with threats to commit a damage or a penal infringement: imprisonment up to 5 years and fine up to €75 000 (outside aggravating circumstances), depending on the country. Particularities in Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000), and Spain (up to €288 000). </li>
            <li>Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes against peace, crimes of genocide,  crimes  against  humanity  and  war  crimes:  Depending  on  the  country, imprisonment  up  to  5  years  and  fine  up  to  €45  000. Particularities  in  Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000), and Spain (up to €144 000). </li>
            <li>Direct or indirect discrimination in certain fields: depending on the country, where penally  sanctioned,  imprisonment  up  to  3  years  and fine  up  to  €45  000. Particularities in Germany (theoretically up to €10 800 000 €53), and Spain (up to €288 000). Administrative fines may reach €50 000</li>

        What is harmful content?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>All illegal content is harmful but not all  harmful content is illegal.  In our content we define  the  words  “Harmful  content”  as  referring  to content  that  is  not  considered  as illegal  and  should  not  be  judged  as  illegal  but  which  might  cause  harm  to  sensitive persons or persons who need additional protection – minors, special needs persons. An example could be the nature of violence in material, or the ideas it supports, or its age-inappropriateness.  In some countries, such content might require rating or prior-notice before being viewed by users. </p>
        <p>This  term  causes  further  confusion  since  some  websites,  such  as  Facebook,  describe harmful  content  as  “content  as  anything  organizing real  world  violence,  theft,  or property  destruction,  or  that  directly  inflicts  emotional  distress  on  a  specific  private individual (e.g. bullying)”, and thereby include, in the "harmful" category, content that might be or that are illegal. They also include a list of prohibited categories of content that can be found in their Community Standards, and which might be either illegal or harmful  (some  of  their  prohibited  contents  include:  naked  or  sexual  content,  hate speech or speech that incites hatred, and violent and graphic contents). They might then decide to prohibit that content on their platforms only.  </p>

        Why are some harmful contents not illegal?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Non illegal harmful content is not illegal in order to preserve the freedom of speech that is necessary to enable democracy and the feeding of public debates. If all the speeches that hurt a third party would be prohibited, democracy and freedom of speech would completely disappear. </p>
        <p>The prohibition of hatred towards "others" is a legitimate aim, since it preserves the rights  of  others.  However,  the  necessity  of  such  a prohibition  is  less  obvious  in  all situations, since hatred might be everywhere and is a common human feeling (see 5.1 above).  Therefore,  societies  must  define  what  morals  and  values  do  absolutely  not tolerate, in order to justify the necessity of its prohibition, while maintaining the level of freedom of speech that is necessary to feed democracy and public debates. And the E. Court H. R. leaves a certain margin of appreciation, to Member States, on the field of morals. </p>
        <p>However, such offensive, shocking and disturbing ideas and content might be harmful for  certain  persons  or  category  of  persons  (see  5.20  above).  Several  tools  enable  to protect these persons, from disclaimers to end-users filtering tools that can be set to meet each individual requirements. </p>

        What is the difference between illegal content and potentially illegal?
      </li>
      <li class="content">
        <p>Only  content  which  has  been  declared  illegal  by  an independent  authorised  judge, according  to  the  penal  procedure  of  the  applicable law  is  considered  illegal.  Content which has been assessed by skilled and trained personnel or by LEA might be declared as potentially illegal. Content made available in an unrestricted manner or to specific groups  or  persons  in  society  might  be  considered  potentially  illegal  (even  if  public content is more likely to be prohibited). Content that is potentially harmful to specific groups is not inherently illegal (see 5.20 and 5.21 above).  Finally some content might be contentious or disruptive but is not likely to be illegal in any situation (see 5.2 above). </p>
